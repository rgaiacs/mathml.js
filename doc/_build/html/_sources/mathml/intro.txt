Introduction
============

As say before, MathML is a specification for describing mathemathics. The
equation below are write using MathML

.. raw:: html
   :file: samples/intro-0.html

and produce by the following code:

.. literalinclude:: samples/intro-0.html

The last version is MathML 3.0 that was release as W3C Recommendation on 21
October 2010.

MathML is an application of XML, Extensible Markup Language, and as such it is
governed by the rules of XML syntax. XML syntax is a notation for rooted
labeled planar trees. Planarity means that the children of a node may be viewed
as given a natural order and MathML depends on this order. 

MathML presentation elements only recommend (i.e., do not require) specific
ways of rendering; this is in order to allow for medium-dependent rendering and
for individual preferences of style.
