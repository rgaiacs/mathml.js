Token Elements
==============

Token elements represent identifiers (``mi``), numbers (``mn``), operators
(``mo``), text (``mtext``), strings (``ms``) and spacing (``mspace``).

mi
--

An ``mi`` element represents a symbolic name or arbitrary text that should be
rendered as an identifier. Identifiers can include variables, function names,
and symbolic constants.

mn
--

An ``mn`` element represents a "numeric literal" or other data that should be
rendered as a numeric literal. Generally speaking, a numeric literal is a
sequence of digits, perhaps including a decimal point, representing an unsigned
integer or real number.
