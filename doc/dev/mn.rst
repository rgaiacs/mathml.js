Actions with mn
===============

In this section we will describe how ``mn`` elements will handle DOM events.

Mouse over and out
------------------

When the pointing device is moved onto an ``mi`` the element should change its
color (default to blue).

When the pointing device is moved away from an ``mi`` it should change its
color back.

This behavior can be achieve changing the color value attribute.
